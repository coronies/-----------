          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found
          throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
          About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
          polar ice, lakes and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is
          land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is
          formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to
          produce mountain ranges, volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid
          outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's
          magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.

            Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is
            the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets,
            it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light
            minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25
            days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis
            in a day. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its
            orbital plane with the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by
            one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at
            380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as
            Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through
            tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis and
            gradually slows its rotation.
